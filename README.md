## Niked - check size availability

Basic script that accepts shoe URL from Nike.com, desired size and checks if it's available.

### Requirements

At the moment it only works with Safari.
You need to enable 'Allow Remote Automation' in 'Develop' menu.


### Limitations
It only runs locally and manually. In future I hope to automate it and make it work in cloud, 
allowing users to be notified once their desired size becomes available.
